# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Code Guidelines
- Use English for commit messages and PR descriptions
- This is a fork of libsvm with significant modifications. Submit PRs to this repository, not the upstream
- All documents with `.md` extension must be written in English
- `docs/FORK.md` records major architectural changes from upstream libsvm. Update only for significant modifications (build system, API changes, major features)
- Add new `.md` files to `docs` if they need to be committed. Use `dev-docs` for temporary, uncommitted files.
